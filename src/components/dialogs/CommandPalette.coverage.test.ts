// The palette went 95 feature commits without gaining a row. Nothing failed,
// because nothing was checking — a palette silently falls behind rather than
// breaking. This is the check.
//
// Every global `open*` action on the UI store is either surfaced by the palette
// or listed below with a reason. Adding a new dialog therefore forces a
// decision at PR time instead of leaving a gap nobody notices for three months.
//
// Source-level rather than render-level on purpose: the rows are built from
// live store state (a task, a project, a sandbox mode), so asserting on a
// rendered list would mean constructing a plausible world and would only prove
// the palette works in THAT world. The invariant here is about coverage, not
// behaviour. Same pattern as cspGuard.test.ts reading tauri.conf.json.
