// The ⌃⇥ walk: hold Control, tap Tab to step back through the places you were
// looking at, ⌃⇧⇥ to step the other way, release Control to land.
//
// A pure decision so the fiddly part is testable, exactly like `doubleTap.ts`.
// And the fiddly part is NOT the stepping — it is everything that must NOT end
// the gesture:
//
//   - Pressing Shift to go backwards fires a `keydown` for "Shift" BEFORE the
//     Tab arrives. A naive "any other key ends it" rule makes ⌃⇧⇥ impossible.
//   - Holding Control auto-repeats `keydown` for "Control" the whole time. The
//     same naive rule would end the gesture on the first repeat, a few dozen ms
//     in.
//
// The ring is a SNAPSHOT taken on the first press. Each step changes what is on
// screen, which feeds the recency list the ring came from; walking the live
// list would reorder it under the next keypress.
