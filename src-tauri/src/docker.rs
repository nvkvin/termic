// Docker sandbox mode (opt-in, experimental). Parallel to `sandbox.rs`,
// but the isolation boundary is a Docker container instead of macOS
// Seatbelt: the agent CLI runs inside `docker run` and can only touch the
// paths we bind-mount (the worktree, its parent `.git`, composition
// members, and a persistent per-agent config dir). Default-deny by
// construction.
//
// This module is PURE command construction + image/container lifecycle.
// No long-running daemon (consistent with the "no backend daemon" rule —
// we only shell out to the user's `docker`). `render_argv` is the single
// source of truth: the argv previewed in the UI and the argv actually
// spawned come from the same function, so they can never drift.

    //    logging in again for each agent AND each clone of one, to end up
    //    holding the same credential in five places.
    //
    //    Note what this is NOT: a mount of the whole `/root/.config`. Nesting
    //    would work (Docker orders mounts by depth, so a per-agent
    //    `.config/opencode` still applies underneath a blanket mount), but an
    //    empty dir over the whole tree SHADOWS what the image put there at
    //    build time - `/root/.config/fish/completions/grok.fish` today, and

    //    failure `agent_dirs.rs` documents for grok, and it would also hand
    //    every agent every credential any other agent ever created, which is
    //    the opposite of the per-agent split above. One named dir at a time,
    //    each one a deliberate choice, is the whole point.

    //    independent reasons: on macOS `gh` keeps the token in the Keychain
    //    (`hosts.yml` holds no `oauth_token` at all), so the mount would hand
    //    the container an unauthenticated gh; a container-side `gh auth
    //    logout` would take out the login `forge.rs` runs termic's own PR
    //    panel on; and Seatbelt hard-denies that same file (`sandbox.rs`), so
