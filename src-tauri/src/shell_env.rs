//! Resolve the user's login-shell environment.
//!
//! GUI-launched .app bundles on macOS inherit a bare env from launchd:
//! a minimal PATH (`/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin`) and none of the
//! variables the user exports from their shell rc. So anything we spawn
//! directly (the agent CLIs, scratch terminals, setup/run scripts) is
//! missing the user's real world:
//!   - PATH — `claude`/`codex` in `~/.local/bin`, nvm/bun shims, etc.
//!     are invisible ("env: claude: No such file or directory", #13/#16).
//!   - EDITOR/VISUAL — Claude Code's Ctrl+G opens the wrong editor (#17).
//!   - LANG, GPG_TTY, tool tokens, … — anything else the rc exports.
//!
//! Fix: shell out to `$SHELL -ilc env`, diff it against our own (bare)
//! env, and inject the delta into everything we spawn. `-l` runs the
//! login profile (`.zprofile`), `-i` runs the interactive rc (`.zshrc`)
//! — both are needed because dynamic installers (nvm, mise, fnm, asdf,
//! bun) typically write to `.zshrc`. Diffing against our own env drops
//! inherited launchd noise (XPC_SERVICE_NAME, …) for free: unchanged
//! keys aren't in the delta.
//!
//! Lifecycle (#186): readers NEVER block on the probe (beyond a bounded
//! 1s courtesy wait while the very first attempt is still in flight, so
//! launch-restored terminals usually get the real env). The state starts
//! as the static fallback and is atomically swapped to the probed env
//! when a probe succeeds. A failed probe is NOT cached forever: the
//! startup loop retries with backoff, and after it gives up, any later
//! read may kick one more background attempt (cooldown-limited), so a
//! transiently slow rc heals without an app restart.
//!
//! VS Code, Cursor, Zed, GitHub Desktop all do the same thing for the
//! same reason. See e.g. microsoft/vscode `shellEnv.ts`.
